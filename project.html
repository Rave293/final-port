Project: Lagos State IBILE Youth Ambassadorship Program 2024
I had the incredible opportunity to work on the Lagos State IBILE Youth Ambassadorship Program, a prestigious youth fellowship designed by Lagos State to empower and engage young leaders across the region. As part of the project, I was responsible for designing all the visual content and written materials to support the program’s communication efforts.
My role involved creating a wide range of graphical assets, including billboards, wallpapers, digital designs, and book layouts, ensuring the visuals aligned with the program's mission and values. I also wrote compelling copy to accompany these designs, helping to communicate the importance of the fellowship and its goals.
In addition to design work, I led the video production aspect of the project, shooting and editing footage of candidates participating in the program and key figures such as the Permanent Secretary and Honourable Commissioner of the Lagos State Ministry of Youth. This included capturing their interviews and moments of the fellowship in action, showcasing the program's impact and the enthusiasm of the youth involved.
The project was a rewarding experience, allowing me to contribute to a meaningful initiative while further developing my skills in branding, design, and multimedia content creation. It was truly inspiring to see the program bring together young people from across Lagos, and I’m proud to have played a role in bringing the vision to life.
