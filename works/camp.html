           FlashChange Marketing Campaign
           I worked closely with the marketing team at FlashChange to drive app downloads and engagement through a strategic influencer campaign. By truly understanding the brand and its target audience, I helped identify the right mix of influencers, including big names like Blaq Bonez and Zlatan and smaller, niche influencers.
           We ran a series of giveaway hashtag campaigns that not only increased social media buzz but also directed users to download the app. This approach boosted engagement, improved brand perception, and drove significant traffic.
           The results were beyond exciting—by the end of 2024, we had achieved over 80,000 app downloads in less than 2 years, proving the power of targeted marketing and influencer partnerships.
           
           
           G126 Travel Community Campaign
           I spearheaded a community-building campaign for G126, a travel company, aimed at growing the brand through strong, engaged communities in Lagos and Port Harcourt. The first step was creating a vibrant travel community, where members could connect, share experiences, and enjoy exclusive perks like travel vouchers and hotel discounts.
           To kick things off, I planned and executed an offline event called Movie in the Park, which attracted over 80 members to its first edition. This event not only built excitement but also strengthened brand awareness and loyalty. The success led to a second event, Movie on the Beach, which further boosted engagement and visibility.
           The impact was clear—brand awareness grew significantly, and sales saw a 10% increase. The community continues to thrive, now with over 700 members in the group chat, creating a solid foundation for long-term brand growth
